  "readme": "# jQuery.ScrollTo\n\n### Installation and usage\n\nUsing [bower](https://github.com/twitter/bower):\n```bash\nbower install jquery.scrollTo\n```\n\n### Notes\n\n* Apart from the target and duration, the plugin can receive a hash of settings. Documentation and examples are included in the source file.\n\n* If you are interested in animated \"same-page-scrolling\" using anchors(href=\"#some_id\"), check http://github.com/flesler/jquery.localScroll\n\n* For a slideshow-like behavior using scrolling, check http://github.com/flesler/jquery.serialScroll\n\n* The target can be specified as:\n  * A Number/String specifying a position using px or just the number.\n  * A string selector that will be relative, to the element that is going to be scrolled, and must match at least one child.\n  * A DOM element, logically child of the element to scroll.\n  * A hash { top:x, left:y }, x and y can be any kind of number/string like described above.\n\n* The plugin supports relative animations\n\n* 'em' and '%' are not supported as part of the target, because they won't work with jQuery.fn.animate.\n  \n* The plugin might fail to scroll an element, to an inner node that is nested in more scrollable elements. This seems like an odd situation anyway.\n\n* Both axes ( x, y -> left, top ) can be scrolled, you can send 'x', 'y', 'xy' or 'yx' as 'axis' inside the settings.\n\n* If 2 axis are scrolled, there's an option to queue the animations, so that the second will start once the first ended ('xy' and 'yx' will have different effects)\n\n* The option 'margin' can be setted to true, then the margin of the target element, will be taken into account and will be deducted.\n\n* 'margin' will only be valid, if the target is a selector, a DOM element, or a jQuery Object.\n\n* The option 'offset' allows to scroll less or more than the actual target by a defined amount of pixels. Can be a number(both axes) or { top:x, left:y }.\n\n* The option 'over' lets you add or deduct a fraction of the element's height and width from the final position. so over:0.5 will scroll to the middle of the object. can be specified with {top:x, left:y}\n\n* Don't forget the callback event is now called 'onAfter', and if queuing is activated, then 'onAfterFirst' can be used.\n\n* If the first axis to be scrolled, is already positioned, that animation will be skipped, to avoid a delay in the animation.\n\n* The call to the plugin can be made in 2 different ways: $().scrollTo( target, duration, settings ) or $().scrollTo( target, settings ). Where one of the settings is 'duration'.\n\n* If you find any bug, or you have any advice, don't hesitate to open an issue. \n",
